## **Summary:**
I am a very active person and I like to learn new things. While studying at the university, I was very interested in 2d and 3d graphics. My classmates and I even tried to make our own mobile game. During my studies, I also managed to work as a bartender-barista, which strengthened my soft skills well. After studying, I worked for a while as an administrator in a veterinary clinic, and then as a layout designer in an advertising agency. At my last job, I realized that I didn't want to make creativity my main occupation. I started freelancing and started studying at the front-end developer at the same time.
